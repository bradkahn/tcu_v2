WARNING:ConstraintSystem:138 - Constraint <NET "sys_clk_100MHz_ext_IN" TNM_NET =
    FFS "TM_sys_clk_100MHz_ext_IN";>
   [/home/brad/tcu_v2/tcu_gateware/constraints/test_1KHz.ucf(55)]: No instances
   of type FFS are driven from "sys_clk_100MHz_ext_IN".

WARNING:ConstraintSystem:56 - Constraint <TIMESPEC TS_sys_clk_100MHz_ext_IN =
   PERIOD "TM_sys_clk_100MHz_ext_IN" 10 ns HIGH 50 %;>
   [/home/brad/tcu_v2/tcu_gateware/constraints/test_1KHz.ucf(56)]: Unable to
   find an active 'TNM' or 'TimeGrp' constraint named
   'TM_sys_clk_100MHz_ext_IN'.

INFO:ConstraintSystem:178 - TNM 'TM_sys_clk', used in period specification
   'TS_sys_clk', was traced into PLL_ADV instance PLL_ADV. The following new TNM
   groups and period specifications were generated at the PLL_ADV output(s): 
   CLKOUT1: <TIMESPEC TS_Inst_clk_wiz_v3_6_clkout1_0 = PERIOD
   "Inst_clk_wiz_v3_6_clkout1_0" TS_sys_clk HIGH 50%>

INFO:ConstraintSystem:178 - TNM 'TM_sys_clk', used in period specification
   'TS_sys_clk', was traced into PLL_ADV instance PLL_ADV. The following new TNM
   groups and period specifications were generated at the PLL_ADV output(s): 
   CLKOUT2: <TIMESPEC TS_Inst_clk_wiz_v3_6_clkout2_0 = PERIOD
   "Inst_clk_wiz_v3_6_clkout2_0" TS_sys_clk / 0.1 HIGH 50%>

WARNING:ConstraintSystem:191 - The TNM 'TM_sys_clk_100MHz_ext_IN', does not
   directly or indirectly drive any flip-flops, latches and/or RAMS and cannot
   be actively used by the referencing Period constraint
   'TS_sys_clk_100MHz_ext_IN'. If clock manager blocks are directly or
   indirectly driven, a new TNM constraint will not be derived even though the
   referencing constraint is a PERIOD constraint unless an output of the clock
   manager drives flip-flops, latches or RAMs. This TNM is used in the following
   user PERIOD specification:
   <TIMESPEC TS_sys_clk_100MHz_ext_IN = PERIOD "TM_sys_clk_100MHz_ext_IN" 10 ns
   HIGH 50 %;> [/home/brad/tcu_v2/tcu_gateware/constraints/test_1KHz.ucf(56)]

WARNING:ConstraintSystem:197 - The following specification is invalid because
   the referenced TNM constraint was removed:
   <TIMESPEC TS_sys_clk_100MHz_ext_IN = PERIOD "TM_sys_clk_100MHz_ext_IN" 10 ns
   HIGH 50 %;> [/home/brad/tcu_v2/tcu_gateware/constraints/test_1KHz.ucf(56)]
